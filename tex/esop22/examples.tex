\subsection{Renaming and substitution}\label{sec:kits}

In an unpublished note, \citet{McBride05} gives a parametrised traversal
yielding homomorphisms of syntax.
The parameters are collected in the record \AgdaRecord{Kit}.
We make a minor change to the original presentation, where instead of our
\AgdaField{ren\textasciicircum{}$\V$} field, \citeauthor{McBride05} has the
field \AgdaField{wk} allowing only context extensions.
As for the other two fields, \AgdaField{vr} allows us to map variables to
$\V$-values, so as to put newly bound variables in environments; and
\AgdaField{tm} allows us to extract terms from $\V$-values, as required when
we use the environment to evaluate a free variable.

\ExecuteMetaData[\Syntactictex]{Kit}

Where \citeauthor{McBride05} gave the traversal explicitly, we go via our
generic semantic traversal.
The first two fields of \AgdaRecord{Semantics} derive directly from fields of
\AgdaRecord{Kit}.
Meanwhile, to handle term constructors, we first \AgdaFunction{reify} to get a
collection of traversed subterms, and then use \AgdaInductiveConstructor{`con}
to assemble these subterms into a similarly shaped syntactic form as we started
with.
The \AgdaField{vr} field is used implicitly in \AgdaFunction{reify}, as it is
used to show that $\V$-identity environments exist.

\ExecuteMetaData[\Syntactictex]{kit-to-sem}

The action of a syntactic traversal on logical rules is basically fixed: we
preserve the logical rule and extend the environment with any newly bound
variables according to \AgdaField{vr}.
Meanwhile, the action on variables is relatively unconstrained: we look up the
variable in the environment to get a $\V$-value, then transform that $\V$-value
into a term using \AgdaField{tm}.

The idea of renaming is that variables replace variables, whereas with
substitution, terms replace variables.
This translates to environments for renaming containing $\sqni$-values
(variables), and environments for substitution containing $\vdash$-values
(terms).

%To implement renaming and substitution for terms, we now just implement
%syntactic kits for variables and terms, respectively.

\ExecuteMetaData[\Syntactictex]{Ren-Kit}

Notice that \AgdaFunction{ren\textasciicircum$\vdash$}, witnessing the fact
that terms are renameable, is a corollary of \AgdaFunction{Ren-Kit}.

\subsection{A denotational semantics}

\todo{Introduction}
To abbreviate this section, we use a simplified syntax compared to \name{}.
We allow for an arbitrary family of base types \AgdaBound{BaseTy}, and a single
type former \mbox{\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{rAToB}}, equivalent to
\mbox{\ExecuteMetaData[\PaperExamplestex]{BangrAToB}} from the earlier system.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{Ty}

In the term syntax, $\lambda$-abstraction now binds a variable with annotation
\AgdaBound{r}, while application needs to scale its argument by \AgdaBound{r}
(both in accordance with the function type they are acting on).

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{AnnArr}

In this subsection, we take the usage annotations to be the 4-element variance
posemiring.
\todo{This works for any semiring.}
We establish the property that all terms are monotonic in their free variables.
This monotonicity can be covariant or contravariant (or neither or both)
depending on the annotation of each free variable.
This provides an additional example to those of \citet{AbelBernardy2020}.
\todo{Cite before here.}

We will take semantics of this system into
\emph{worldly relations}~\cite{AbelBernardy2020}.
A worldly relation over a poset of worlds \AgdaBound{W} is a set over which
we have a \AgdaBound{W}-indexed binary relation satisfying a presheaf-like
property with respect to the order on \AgdaBound{W}.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{WRel}

\begin{example}
  When \AgdaBound{W} is the 1-element set, a worldly relation is just a set
  equipped with a binary relation.
\end{example}

Morphisms between worldly relations \AgdaBound{R} and \AgdaBound{S} consist of
a mapping between the underlying sets such that that mapping preserves
relatedness from \AgdaBound{R} to \AgdaBound{S}.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{WRelMor}

\todo{Define big intersection.}
When the poset of worlds forms a (relational) commutative monoid, such worldly
relations support a symmetric monoidal closed structure.
We reuse the bunched connectives \AgdaRecord{$I^*$}, \AgdaRecord{$\sep$}, and
\AgdaRecord{$\wand$}, now over worlds rather than contexts.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{IR}
\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{tensorR}
\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{lollyR}

The final piece of sematics we need is a \emph{bang} operator.
\todo{No instead}
Instead of requiring extra algebraic structure on the worlds, we allow the
semantic \emph{bang} to be an arbitrary annotation-indexed functor on worldly
relations.
This functor must respect all of the structure on the indices, making it a
graded comonad over multiplication, as well as being lax monoidal at any
particular index \AgdaBound{r}.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{Bang}

\begin{example}
  With \AgdaBound{W} being the 1-element set and annotations coming from the
  variance semiring, we can define the following \emph{bang}.
  It is always the identity on the set component, while the relation component
  consists of flipping the relation for contravariance and taking conjunctions
  to achieve both covariance and contravariance.
  When we want neither covariance nor contravariance, we use the always true
  predicate on worlds \AgdaFunction{$\dot1$}.

  \ExecuteMetaData[\Monotonicitytex]{BangR}
\end{example}

To associate semantics to syntax, we start as standard by associating worldly
relations to types.
We also extend the semantics of types to contexts, using \AgdaFunction{I$^R$},
\AgdaFunction{$\otimes^R$}, and \AgdaField{!$^R$} to interpret the empty
context, concatenation, and usage annotations on singletons, respectively.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{sem}

The semantics of a term is then to be a morphism from the interpretation of the
context to the interpretation of the term's type.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{sem-vdash}

Variables are given semantics by \AgdaFunction{lookup$^R$} (definition omitted).

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{lookupR-type}

Now, we give a \AgdaRecord{Semantics}.
The choice of \AgdaBound{$\V$} as
\AgdaRecord{\AgdaUnderscore{}$\sqni$\AgdaUnderscore{}} is somewhat arbitrary,
given that a standard denotational semantics would not use intermediate
environments in the same sense as renaming and substitution, but allows us to
reuse the standard facts that variables support renaming and identity
environments.
With this choice of \AgdaBound{$\V$} and \AgdaBound{$\C$}, we interpret
environment entries by \AgdaFunction{lookup$^R$}.
Meanwhile, for the logical rules, we ignore environments by using
\AgdaFunction{reify} to just deal with morphisms in an extended context.
As such, $\lambda$-abstractions are easy to interpret, while applications
require some massaging to remove the extension by an empty context, followed by
some plumbing to split the interpretation of the context according to the usage
constraints and feed the interpretation of the argument \AgdaBound{n$'$} into
the interpretation of the function \AgdaBound{m$'$}.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{Wrel}

In order to map open terms to interpretations, we take the action of the
semantics and give the identity renaming as the starting environment.

\ExecuteMetaData[\WReltex]{wrel}

\begin{example}
  We can make a subtraction function from primitive addition and negation on
  integers.
  Subtraction is covariant in its first argument and contravariant in its
  second argument.
  We give the definition in pseudocode, as we have not yet seen how to
  conveniently write terms (\cref{sec:usage-elaborator}).

  \begin{align*}
    &{\sim\sim}p :
      {\uparrow\uparrow}\mathbb Z \multimap
      {\uparrow\uparrow}\mathbb Z \multimap \mathbb Z,
      {\sim\sim}n : {\downarrow\downarrow}\mathbb Z \multimap \mathbb Z
      \vdash \mathnormal{minus} :
      {\uparrow\uparrow}\mathbb Z \multimap
      {\downarrow\downarrow}\mathbb Z \multimap
      \mathbb Z
    \\
    &\mathnormal{minus} \coloneqq \lambda x.~\lambda y.~p\,x\,(n\,y)
  \end{align*}

  We observe that the set component of this term's semantics is just the
  expected Agda function when the two free variables are given appropriate
  interpretations.

  \ExecuteMetaData[\Monotonicitytex]{minus-set}

  Furthermore, the relational component of the semantics yields the free
  theorem that the Agda subtraction so defined is monotonic in the expected way.
  This relies on library proofs that addition and negation are suitably
  monotonic.

  \ExecuteMetaData[\Monotonicitytex]{thm}
\end{example}

\subsection{A usage elaborator}\label{sec:usage-elaborator}

Using the constructs we have seen so far, producing example terms soon becomes
extremely tedious.
We achieved some abbreviation by using pattern synonyms, but we still have to
produce essentially bespoke proofs whenever we use a usage-sensitive part of the
syntax.
The size of each of these proofs is roughly proportional to the number of free
variables, so the amount of proof we have to write grows roughly quadratically
with the size of terms.
An additional factor, which we can't see on paper, is that type checking time
for these proofs soon becomes prohibitive to interactive development.

Our aim in this subsection is to automate usage constraint proofs, making terms
both easier to write and more performant to check.
We invoke the automation by writing terms in a syntax where usage constraints
have been trivialised, and then use a semantic traversal over the simplified
syntax to try to produce a fully elaborated term in the original syntax.
We write the automation in a way that is generic in the syntax description, thus
avoiding repetition and facilitating the prototyping of new type systems.

The type of syntax descriptions depends on the type of usage annotations because
of variable binding.
For example, in the $\oc_{\gr r}$-E rule of \cref{fig:lr-comb}, the right
premise binds a new variable with annotation $\gr r$, where $\gr r$ is drawn
from the ambient posemiring.
The scaling combinator also makes direct reference to the posemiring.
To produce a simplified syntax description, where usage constraints are
trivialised, we set the ambient posemiring to the 1-element $\mathbf0$
posemiring.
In contrast to syntax descriptions, even though types can contain usage
annotations, the type of types does not depend on the type of usage annotations.
This means that, in our simplified syntax, terms have types from the original
system even though variables have trivial usage annotations.
We define the $\mathbf0$ posemiring as follows, being careful to use the
0-field record type \AgdaRecord{$\top$} so that everything algebraic gets
solved by Agda's $\eta$-laws.
Indeed, in this very definition, all of the semiring operations and laws are
canonically inferred.

\ExecuteMetaData[\UsageChecktex]{0-poSemiring}

The elaboration process is monadic.
In particular, we use the \AgdaDatatype{List}/non-determinism monad to give
\emph{all} of the possible annotation choices on the free variables of a term.
We believe the commitment to multiple solutions is inherent when the syntax
contains \AgdaInductiveConstructor{`$\dot1$}.
For example, in the intermediate stages of elaborating
$\plr{\vdash \lambda x.~\plr{*,*}} : A \multimap \top \otimes \top$ with a
usage counting posemiring (assuming reasonable rules for $\top$ and $\otimes$),
it is unclear whether to use the variable $x$ in the left $*$ or the right $*$.
This uncertainty should be reflected in the final result.

The non-deterministic choices we make during elaboration are enumerated by
the fields of \AgdaRecord{NonDetInverses}.
These choices are driven by the typing rules and a candidate usage vector for
the conclusion.
For example, \AgdaField{+$^{-1}$}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{r} is needed when we
encounter a \AgdaInductiveConstructor{`$\sep$} in the syntax and the candidate
usage annotation we are considering is \AgdaBound{r}.
Then, \AgdaField{+$^{-1}$}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{r} is a list of pairs of
annotations \AgdaBound{p} and \AgdaBound{q} that \AgdaBound{r} can split into,
together with a proof of the splitting.
For \AgdaField{0\#$^{-1}$} and \AgdaField{1\#$^{-1}$}, inverses to constants,
we are given the candidate \AgdaBound{r} and typically return an empty list if
the constraint cannot be satisfied, or a singleton list containing a proof.
\AgdaField{*$^{-1}$} is used when we encounter scaling, in which case we know
both the scaling factor \AgdaBound{r} (from the syntax description) and the
candidate \AgdaBound{q}.
These inverse operations combine monadically (in fact, applicatively) to give
inverses to the vector operations of zero, addition, scaling, and basis.

\ExecuteMetaData[\UsageChecktex]{NonDetInverses}

We choose the \AgdaBound{$\V$} of our semantics to be (unannotated) variables.
For the \AgdaBound{$\C$}, we consider \emph{functions} from candidate usage
vectors \AgdaBound{R} to the list of elaborated derivations with usage
annotations given by \AgdaBound{R}.
The module name \AgdaModule{U} refers to the fact that we are taking the
ambient posemiring to be $\mathbf0$ in \AgdaFunction{OpenFam}.
The effect on \AgdaFunction{OpenFam} is that the usage annotations of any
contexts we consider are uninformative (hence the \AgdaSymbol{\_} on the left).

\ExecuteMetaData[\UsageChecktex]{C}

To traverse the unannotated terms, we produce a \AgdaRecord{Semantics} over the
unannotated system \AgdaFunction{uSystem}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{sys}.
We already know that variables are renameable.
To interpret a variable, we consider all the possible proofs that such a
variable could be well annotated, and package them up as a variable term.

\ExecuteMetaData[\UsageChecktex]{elab-sem}

\ExecuteMetaData[\UsageChecktex]{lemma-type}

To actually use \AgdaFunction{elab-sem} on terms, we take the associated
\AgdaFunction{semantics} and pass it the identity environment (an identity
\emph{renaming} in this case, because $\V$ is a family of variables).
The candidate usage vector \AgdaBound{R} will be empty for closed terms, and
otherwise we have to supply the intended usage annotations.
