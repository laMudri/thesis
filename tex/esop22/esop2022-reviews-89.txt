Paper summary
-------------
This paper defines a logical framework for specifying substructral
simple type systems, which is embedded in Agda, and specifically focuses
on systems where the typing judgement annotates each variable in the
context with a resource, in the style following Girard's linear logic
with subexponentials.  The framework provides some logical connectives
for specifying inference rules, including a cartesian and separating
conjunction and scaling.  The framework consists of a definition of the
syntax of inference rules, along with a very general traversal of the
syntax, which is instantiated to define syntactic operations (renaming
and substitution), semantic models (a worlds interpretation), and
implementation phases (a resource inference mechanism).  The framework
handles natural deduction systems, and a couple of examples are given
--- a standard resource-annotated intuitionistic lambda calculus, along
with a resource-annotated classical logic (which shows the flexibility
of the framework to represent systems whose structure differs from the
framework itself).

Strengths
---------
Overall, I think the paper is a strong contribution that is very
deserving of publication in ESOP.  The framework seems very well-suited
to representing resource-annotated type systems, and should have a large
number of instances.  The Agda implementation seems like it will be a
useful library for researchers working on these topics.  The generic
traversal, which gives weakening, substitution, models, type inference
as instances, seems very broadly applicable.  The use of a bit of linear
algebra (vectors and matrix multiplication) to represent substitutions
between resources in a functional style is quite clever, and seems less
fiddly than the usual inductive definition.

Weaknesses
----------
The general idea of a logical framework embedded in Agda is certainly
not new, and the the generic follows the same structure as some
previous work [3]. But it is an important contribution to show that
this all structure extends to sub-structural type systems, and the
design here is quite elegant.

Explanation of your recommendation and comments to authors
----------------------------------------------------------
Technical comments:

Page 2: It might be worth giving some general guidance about how to
think about the orientation of <= --- it was quite surprising in Example
1 that "infinity" is the *bottom* of the order.  I don't think I saw
this example stated in the paper, but I think this means that if you
encoded n-linear affine logic (linear logic with weakening), "less than"
would actually be "greater than" (e.g., so that 2 x : A |- x : A is
well-typed by weakening away one use of x).

Page 3: In the "An element of a chosen posemiring" paragraph, it would
help to define <= on vectors (the green scripty P's and Q's that occur
in the typing rules) --- I assume this means pointwise <= of resources?

Page 4: It would have helped me to have an explicit comment about what
isomorphisms you're eliding when representing resource vectors (the
script P and script Q) in different ways.  In Section 2, the notion of
vector is used informally.  In Section 3, it says that that a context is
a tree, and a P or Q is a function from positions in the tree (which I
interpret as tree paths?) to resources.  Later on, in Section 5, the P
and Q are treated as vectors / functions from size(Delta) to R.  Just
before Section 3, with the comment about matrix notation, you could also
explain how you are numbering the leaves of the tree to convert between
these perspectives, and refer back to this when you switch perspectives.
At first read, "type checking" Section 5 was difficult for me.
Additionally, it's not really clear to me why P and Q are roman and
black at the top of page 4 but scripty and green in Section 3, if you're
making these conversions implicit.  

Page 5: At the very top, when you say "<= 1" it would be good to refer
back to a comment suggested above about the orientation of <= --- this
was confusing to me until I realized it was probably flipped from <= on
natural numbers.  It would also be good to reminder the reader that
<= might just be equality (e.g. to model linear logic).

Page 5: "conflicts" -> "contexts"

Page 5, bottom: As far as I understand, the resource 0 doesn't have any
special status with respect to the preorder <=.  So why does R <= 0 get
a "connective" in the framework, but not, say, 0 <= R or R <= 1 (all
1's) or for some other vector etc.?  Would something technical go wrong
(like Lemma 3/Lemma 4/Lemma 5 on page 14 failing for these connectives),
or are they just not useful?

Page 7, top: broken ref to Figure 2

Page 9: As far as I can tell, the *c and I*c and r.c used in the
definition of [[_]]p are not defined defined anywhere.  Presumably these
are some lifting of the bunched connectives on page 5 to OpenTypes (Ctx
-> Set), but since page 5 is defined for resource vectors, not contexts,
I'm not sure exactly what you mean.  And don't you need a xc rather than
the Agda x for interpreting `x?

Page 12: In Definition 5.1, I found the role of the Q' confusing at
first.  What I think is happening is that, a priori, it looks like you
are quantifying over some resources entirely unrelated to P or Q, but
the backwards-in assumption that comes later constrains it to be a unit
vector, so quantifying over all Q' is really just a convenience (there
is only 1 Q' to check for each position in delta).

Page 13: In Lemma 2, there is some Agda creeping in (rho.Psi) that
hasn't exactly been defined, since you gave Definition 4 in words, not
as a record type.

Page 14: In Lemma 6, has the \forall[ _ ->dot _ ] notation been defined?

Page 25: It would be good to give some empirical sense for how well this
resource elaborator works --- what examples is it able to handle, what
times out, etc.? 

Page 25: The type systems for Amortized Automated Resource Analysis by
         Hofman, Jost, Hoffmann, etc. have the flavor of these
         resource-annotated type systems -- can you encode those?

It would also be nice to show that you can encode a system with
"non-logical" rules, e.g. some of the primitives for
differential privacy in [18].  Both of the examples in the
paper deal only with the "logical connectives", but I imagine
many of the applications of the framework will keep the same
connectives but add domain-specific primitives.  

Page 25: What are the prospects for extending the framework beyond
         simple types, e.g. to handle resource polymorphism
         (quantification over resources) or dependent types?

Questions for authors’ response
---------------------------------
Please clarify the "Page 9: As far as I can tell, the *c and I*c and
r.c used in the definition of [[_]]p are not defined defined
anywhere. " to help me understand this definition.

Paper summary
-------------
This paper develops a framework to assist the mechanisation of (a
class of) substructural type systems, aiming to provide a similar
experience to that of mechanising the metatheory of structural type
systems. The framework focuses on type systems whose substructurality
is captured by usage indices drawn from a (partially ordered)
semiring.  The overall approach models such systems in an
intrinsically typed manner, developing a metasyntax of typing rules,
leveraging a series of combinators to facilitate the handling of
resource management and binding.
To build terms in a type system described by the framework, the
authors introduce some auxiliary definitions to facilitate talking
about types indexed over contexts, judgment forms and judgements that
admit new bound variables, which are then used to give meaning to
the metasyntax used to represent such systems.

To show the generality of the approach, the authors show how to
represent a prototypical subsystem of the work of Wood and Atkey [19],
and a usage-annotated variant of the System L in natural deduction form. 

In terms of reasoning about the metatheory of the represented systems,
the authors define traversals over their (meta)terms which can be used
to define operations such as renaming and substitution (which are type
preserving due to the intrinsically typed nature of the framework) and
to give denotational semantics.

To facilitate the use of the framework, namely in terms of proof
obligations, the authors develop an elaborator for usage data.

The framework is fully formalized in Agda.

Strengths
---------
- A very general approach to defining substructural type systems based
  on usages, in principle applying to an entire class of systems.
- Type-system generic properties can be derived uniformly.
- Fully mechanised.

Weaknesses
----------
- Extremely dense in notation and fairly sparse in giving intuitions
  of what's going on.
- Can only really be followed by an expert in this kind of extremely
  general formalization in Agda.
- The applicability of the framework in terms of metareasoning
   beyond the use cases in the paper is not really discussed and
   the automation/elaborator is not really exercised in the presentation.

Explanation of your recommendation and comments to authors
----------------------------------------------------------
I will preface my review by stating that I am knowledgeable in the
area of substructural type systems and their formalization techniques,
although not so much in this kind of extremely generic formulation.

Overall I think that the presented work has a lot of potential, and
generally delivers on its promises. The developed machinery does
provide a generic way of representing usage-based substructural type
systems, renaming and substitution, but the presentation is extremely
opaque and makes very little effort in appealing to any but the most
expert readers.

Generally speaking, the presentation is mostly fine up to the point
where building terms of a described system is explained, where the
authors simply give a series of Agda definitions with minimal
explanation of what the definitions actually do, only giving very
vague/high-level intuitions of what the definitions are actually
doing. The usual Agda abuse of mixfix notation does little to help in
this regard as well. More effort in making the paper readable by a
wider audience is simply necessary.

I am fine with the later sections of a paper being of a technical
nature when the bigger picture is clear, but I expect to read this
kind of paper and be able to understand (1) how to, in principle, use
this framework to define a type system and some of its metatheory;
(2) what kind of metatheoretical reasoning I can expect to derive in
this way.

In terms of (1), the paper mostly delivers on the first half,
but the definition of traversals is again a series of Agda definitions
with extremely dense notation that is not really explained. At the
very least, I would expect a kind of wrap-up that explains *how* to
use the machinery and not just very nice looking unicode.

In terms of (2), the authors exercise their semantic traversals by
giving a renaming, a substitution, denotational semantics and usage
elaborator traversals. The clarity of these varies a bit, but I
generally miss a bigger picture explanation here -- what kind of
"things" can I expect to reasonably define as traversals? Defining a
traversal in this sense means mapping into Semantics, but the authors
never even state this. More care is needed to make the paper
accessible to the audience.

Finally, the authors define an elaborator of usages in section 7.3.,
effectively presenting a kind of linearity checker / annotater,
motivated by the fact that actually writing terms in the framework can
become tedious due to the need for proofs dealing with usage reasoning
(and the time it takes for Agda to type check these). An elaborator
for this is great, but how can I use it? I understand space was
already short, but this section really doesn't work as is, in my opinion.

Concretely, I think some of the examples in the paper
(e.g. Examples 8-10) could be cut for extra space so that definitions,
roadmaps and actual explanations can be given in a way that makes the
paper understandable to a wider audience. This is not just a reviewer
being capricious -- the work is a mechanized (meta)framework
that can be used to define and reason about substructural type
systems. The paper must make it clear *how* people other than
the authors can do this.

Typos and related issues:

Paper contents overflow to page 26.

p1, line 1: we concern?

p2 par1: odd phrasing, "The way Allais et al. consolidate and codify
... , we aim to replicate ...". We aim to replicate the way ...

p2, last par before sect 2: missing final .

p7, par1: broken figure ref.

p7, last par: decsription

p13 first par: Each of the rows in the matrix is a basis vector
because variables can only be formed in contexts with basis
annotations or less.

Questions for authors’ response
---------------------------------
What other kind of meta-theoretical properties
do the authors see as being made easier to define/show using
their framework?

The elaborator for usages is seemingly defined in a generic way. How
does one actually use it?



Review #89C
===========================================================================

Overall merit
-------------
B. OK paper, but I will not champion it

Confidence
----------
Z. I am not an expert; my evaluation is that of an informed outsider

Paper summary
-------------
The paper presents a (meta)theoretic technique for generically
encoding substructural type systems, allowing generic metatheory over
them.

Strengths
---------
Addressing the need to repeat metatheory for similar but different
systems is a worthwhile goal.

Weaknesses
----------
The presentation could be improved to require less background reading,
perhaps at the cost of shifting some content into the appendix.  The
discussion of related work is sparse.

Explanation of your recommendation and comments to authors
----------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this work is worthwhile, but the paper would benefit from
changes in structure.  There's a lot going on, which is positive, but
part of the job of a paper is to convince the reader to stay and read
deeply.  My main suggestion is to spend more time on the parts that
may be settled prior work to the authors, but are not settled or even
known for many readers.  If you can get a reader to believe firmly
that Figure 1 is just a different way of representing a standard type
system they already care about, they will stick with the rest of the
paper.  Basically: Expand section 3, starting with a non-intrinsic
version of Figure 1; explain how to get from the non-intrinsic system
to Figure 1; explain how to get to Figure 2.  With the ESOP page limit
this might require moving some material to the appendix, which is
never something I enjoy doing as an author, but I think it would be
worth doing.

My second suggestion is that while the paper cites the work it
extends, and some related work, it's missing a unified discussion of
related work.  More importantly, it's missing some work that may be
related: ambient contexts are used in higher-order abstract syntax (as
in LF/Twelf and its successors), for example, corresponding to the
elision of Rγ when we move from the Figure 1 system to the Figure 2
system.  Adding remarks along the lines of "if you know higher-order
abstract syntax encodings, then..." doesn't solve everything because
not everyone is familiar with those, but it's worth considering.  You
want to get across that the work is new and interesting, maybe a
little strange if it's not what you're used to, but not completely
different from what's come before.

Section 1:

"In this paper, we concern": "we consider"?

Missing period in sentence just above Section 2.

Section 2:

In Definition 2, in the first line, I take it that → is implication,
and so the first line is equivalent to "If r ≤ r' and u ≤ u' then r ·
u ≤ r' · u' ".  If this were written in words, it would require no
guessing as to what → means (→ being a rather popular symbol in PL
papers) and should still fit on one line.  Making the quantifiers
explicit ("For all r, r', u, u' ", etc.) wouldn't hurt.

Same goes for Definition 3.

Section 3:

In Figure 1, *adding* some conventional notation, such as a rule name
to the right of the line, would make this easier to follow.  I had
just enough experience with the intrinsic style to not be totally
lost.  Additional space around the colons might help too.

The explanation of Figure 1 is sparse.  The subtext I got was "go read
[19] first".  If I do have to read [19] first to understand this
paper, maybe say that upfront.  I would like to have more than 13
lines to understand 7 rules given in a not entirely conventional
style.

It might ease the reader's job to give the whole system, or at least
one or two rules, in a non-intrinsic style first.  Then, explain in
detail how some of the Figure 1 rules correspond to the non-intrinsic
rules.

Is the "Rγ" notation chosen for a reason, compared to something like
R; γ?

"we make use the separating": drop "make"
"supressed" should be "suppressed", same for "supression"

Section 4:

"Figure ??": Figure 2?

"We now start to use Agda notation…to emphasise that our framework has
been implemented": It would be helpful to explain some of that
notation, at least in the first part of 4.1.

4.2: mention that "MMT" stands for "mu mu-tilde", e.g., by introducing
"the μμ~-calculus (pronounced 'mu mu-tilde')"

Section 5:

"When considering values, the fact that P' ≤ Q' Ψ reduces to P' ≤ Q'."
This was hard to parse.  I think I understood the meaning, but would
dropping the word "that" be another way to say what the authors mean?
"...the fact P' ≤ Q' Ψ reduces to P' ≤ Q' ".
