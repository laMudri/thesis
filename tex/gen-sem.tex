The traversal \AgdaFunction{trav} from the last section is generic in the sense
that $\V$, the type of entries in an environment, can be instantiated to many
different things.
However, in practice we only use $\ni$ and $\vdash$, giving us renaming and
substitution, respectively.
This is because \AgdaFunction{trav} only targets terms, and does so by keeping
term constructors intact and replacing only the variables by things from the
environment.
This makes substitution the most general possible traversal.

If we want to capture a broader range of traversals, including not just
syntactic but also \emph{semantic} operations, we must be able to target things
other than terms, and act in an interesting way on term constructors.
Doing a straight generalisation of the type of \AgdaFunction{trav}, this
suggests that we want a function with the following type.
