We start with a data type \AgdaDatatype{\_⊢\_} of intrinsically simply typed
terms.
Beside base types, the only type former we have is the function type constructor
\AgdaInductiveConstructor{\_`→\_}.
Contexts (of type \AgdaRecord{Ctx}) are implemented as the free magma on types
(\AgdaDatatype{Ty}).
Context concatenation is \AgdaFunction{\_++ᶜ\_}, and \AgdaFunction{[\_]ᶜ}
embeds types into contexts.
Typed variables in a context are given by \AgdaRecord{\_∋\_}.
A variable in
\AgdaBound{$\Gamma$}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaRecord{$\ni$}\AgdaSpace{}\AgdaBound{A}
is given by a path \AgdaField{idx} to a type in \AgdaBound{$\Gamma$}, together
with a proof \AgdaField{tyq} that this type is equal to \AgdaBound{A}.
Variables embed into terms via the \AgdaInductiveConstructor{var} constructor.
