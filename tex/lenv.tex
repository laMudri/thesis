\begin{remark}
  Given an environment $\rho : \grP\gamma \env\V \grQ\delta$ and a $\grPprime$
  and a $\grQprime$ such that $\grPprime = \grQprime\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi}$,
  there is also an environment of type $\grPprime\gamma \env\V \grQprime\delta$
  with the same linear map and action on variables.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
  The only part of the definition of an environment dependent on $\grP$ or
  $\grQ$ is the constraint $\grP = \grQ\gr\Psi$, which we are able to replace
  for $\grPprime$ and $\grQprime$.
\end{proof}

When constructing an environment, we can do so by cases on the shape of the
target context.
We can create an environment into the empty context when all usage annotations
on the source context are $\gr0$.
We can create an environment into a concatenated context when we can additively
split up the annotations of the source context and produce environments into
both halves from the split sources.
We can create an environment into a singleton context when there is a context
$\gr r$ times smaller than the source context in which we can produce a value
of the appropriate type.

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:construct-env}
  We can define all of the following equivalences for any values of the free
  variables.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\forallb{I \dotlr \plr{{-} \env\V {\cdot}}}$
    \item $\forallb{\plr{{-} \env\V \Gamma} \sep \plr{{-} \env\V \Delta}
      \dotlr \plr{{-} \env\V \Gamma, \Delta}}$
    \item
      $\forallb{\gr r \cdot \plr{\V\,(-)\,A} \dotlr \plr{{-} \env\V \gr rA}}$
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  There are 6 cases to check.
  Throughout, we write $\Gamma$ as $\grP\gamma$ and $\Delta$ as $\grQ\delta$
  when convenient.
  \begin{description}
    \item[$I(\to)$]
      Let $\gr\Psi$ be the unique linear map out of the zero space.
      By definition, $\gr0 = \grQ\gr\Psi$.
      There are no variables to act upon.
    \item[$I(\gets)$]
      $\grQ\gr\Psi$ is an empty sum, so if $\grP = \grQ\gr\Psi$ then
      $\grP = \gr0$.
    \item[$\sep(\to)$]
      Let the given environments be $\rho : \grRl\theta \env\V \Gamma$ and
      $\sigma : \grRr\theta \env\V \Delta$, with $\grR = \grRl + \grRr$.
      Define $\gr\Psi \coloneqq [\rho.\gr\Psi, \sigma.\gr\Psi]$, using the
      coproduct structure of the concatenated vector space.
      We have $\grR = \grRl + \grRr =
      \grP\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi} + \grQ\plr{\sigma.\gr\Psi} =
      \plr{\grP, \grQ}\gr\Psi$.
      To act on variables, we are given
      $\grRprime = \plr{\grPprime, \grQprime}\gr\Psi$ and
      $\grPprime\gamma, \grQprime\delta \sqni A$.
      Without loss of generality, let us have $\grPprime\gamma \sqni A$ and
      $\grQprime = \gr0$.
      Thus, $\grRprime = \grPprime\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi}$, and we can act on the
      variable using $\rho$.
    \item[$\sep(\gets)$]
      Let the unnamed context be $\Theta$, also written $\grR\theta$.
      The linear map
      $\gr\Psi : \Ann^{\size\Gamma + \size\Delta} \to \Ann^{\size\Theta}$ splits
      into
      $\gr\Psi_{\gr l} : \Ann^{\size\Gamma} \to \Ann^{\size\Theta}
      \coloneqq \langle \id, 0 \rangle; \gr\Psi$ and
      $\gr\Psi_{\gr r} : \Ann^{\size\Delta} \to \Ann^{\size\Theta}
      \coloneqq \langle 0, \id \rangle; \gr\Psi$, using the product structure of
      the concatenated vector space.
      Let $\grRl \coloneqq \grP\gr\Psi_{\gr l}$ and
      $\grRr \coloneqq \grQ\gr\Psi_{\gr r}$, by definition satisfying the
      required equations.
      For the action on variables, let us consider the left environment.
      We are given $\grRprime = \grPprime\gr\Psi_{\gr l}$ and
      $\grPprime\gamma \sqni A$.
      From these, we get
      $\grRprime = \grPprime\gr\Psi_{\gr l} = \plr{\grPprime, \gr0}\gr\Psi$ and
      $\grPprime\gamma, \gr0\delta \sqni A$.
      We can therefore act using the original environment.
    \item[$\cdot(\to)$]
      Let $\grP$ and $\grPprime$ be such that $\grP = \gr r\grPprime$ and let
      $v : \V\,\grPprime\gamma\,A$.
      Let $\gr\Psi : \Ann \to \Ann^{\size\gamma}
      \coloneqq \gr r\gr' \mapsto \gr r\gr'\grPprime$.
      By definition and the previous assumption, we have $\grP = \gr r\gr\Psi$.
      When acting on a variable, we have $\grP\gr{''} = \gr r\gr'\gr\Psi$
      and $\gr r\gr'A \sqni A'$.
      The latter tells us that $A = A'$ and $\gr r\gr' = \gr1$.
      Thus, $\grP\gr{''} = \grPprime$.
      We therefore need a value of type $\V\,\grPprime\gamma\,A$, which we can
      take to be $v$.
    \item[$\cdot(\gets)$]
      Let us have an environment of type $\grP\gamma \env\V \gr rA$.
      We want to use its action on variables to yield a value.
      To do this, we let $\grPprime \coloneqq \gr1\gr\Psi$, and use this
      equation, together with the fact that we have a variable of type
      $\gr1A \sqni A$, to get a value of type $\V\,\grPprime\gamma\,A$.
      Furthermore, we derive $\grP = \gr r\gr\Psi = \gr r\grPprime$, as
      required.
  \end{description}
\end{proof}

We could, indeed, use these three clauses to define what an environment is.
However, I find them difficult to work with, as it is often easier to do
linear algebraic proofs separately from the rest of an environment.
For identity and composition, as we are about to see, the original definition
is easier to use because we can rely on the identity and composition of linear
maps.
Concretely, an inductive proof of identity would, for example, involve
constructing an environment of type
$\grP\gamma, \grQ\delta \env\V \grP\gamma, \grQ\delta$ by constructing
environments of types $\grP\gamma, \gr0\delta \env\V \grP\gamma$ and
$\gr0\gamma, \grQ\delta \env\V \grQ\delta$.
These are not identity environments, so we would have to strengthen the
induction hypothesis.

The requirements for identity and composition of environments look a bit like
the unit and lift of a Kleisli triple.

\begin{lemma}[Identity environment]
  Given a function $\mathrm{vr} : \forallb{{\sqni} \dotto \V}$, for any
  $\Gamma$ we have an environment of type $\Gamma \env\V \Gamma$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\gr\Psi$ be the identity map, which clearly satisfies
  $\grP = \grP\gr\Psi$.
  When acting on a variable, the equation $\grPprime = \grQprime\gr\Psi$ means
  that $\grPprime = \grQprime$, so we want, from a variable of type
  $\grPprime\gamma \sqni A$, a value of type $\V\,\grPprime\gamma\,A$, which
  we can get from $\mathrm{vr}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:env-comp-lemma}
  Given an environment $\rho : \Gamma \env\U \Delta$ for which we have, for any
  $\grPprime$ and $\grQprime$ such that
  $\grPprime = \grQprime\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi}$, we have a function
  $\mathrm{lift}_\rho :
  \forallb{\V\,\grQprime\delta \dotto \W\,\grPprime\gamma}$,
  we can map environments of type $\Delta \env\V \Theta$ into environments of
  type $\Gamma \env\W \Theta$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\rho$ be as in the statement, and let $\sigma : \Delta \env\V \Theta$.
  For the environment we are constructing, let
  $\gr\Psi \coloneqq \sigma.\gr\Psi; \rho.\gr\Psi$, noting that
  $\grP = \grQ\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi} =
  \plr{\grR\plr{\sigma.\gr\Psi}}\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi}$.
  For the action on variables, we are given $\grPprime = \grRprime\gr\Psi$ with
  $\grRprime\theta \sqni A$.
  We can immediately apply the action of $\sigma$, giving us a value of type
  $\V\,\plr{\grRprime\plr{\sigma.\gr\Psi}}\,A$.
  We note that
  $\grPprime = \plr{\grRprime\plr{\sigma.\gr\Psi}}\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi}$, and
  apply $\mathrm{lift}_\rho$ to get the desired value.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Composition of environments]
  Given a function
  $\mathrm{lift} : \plr{\rho : \grP\gamma \env\U \grQ\delta} \to
  \forall \grPprime, \grQprime.~\grPprime = \grQprime\plr{\rho.\gr\Psi} \to
  \forallb{\V\,\grQprime\delta \dotto \W\,\grPprime\gamma}$, then we can
  compose environments of types $\Gamma \env\U \Delta$ and
  $\Delta \env\V \Theta$ into an environment of type $\Gamma \env\W \Theta$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{example}
  We can derive the following instances of environment composition.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $\U = \V = \W = {\sqni}$, then $\mathrm{lift}$ is given by the
      action of the renaming $\rho$ on variables.
      This allows us to derive composition of renamings.
    \item More generally, if $\V = {\sqni}$ and $\U = \W$, we can still use
      the action of the environment $\rho$.
      This means that renamings post-compose with any other sort of environment.
    \item If $\V = \W = {\vdash}$, then $\mathrm{lift}$ is given by a
      syntactic traversal.
      For example, if $\U = {\sqni}$, we need the action of renaming on terms
      to show that a renaming followed by a substitution composes to a
      substitution.
      If $\U = {\vdash}$, then the action of substitution on terms gives us that
      substitutions compose.
    \item More generally, if $\V = {\vdash}$ and we have a semantics from
      $\U$ to $\W$, then $\mathrm{lift}$ can be given by the semantic traversal
      of terms.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

% Concatenation is difficult; save to after I've talked about renamings.

% Finally for this section, we give the conditions under which the
% context-forming operations (empty, concatenation, and singleton) have a
% functorial action with respect to $\V$-environments.
%
% \begin{lemma}
%   For any $\V$, there is an environment ${\cdot} \env\V {\cdot}$.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   By \autoref{thm:construct-env}, it suffices to show $I\,{\cdot}$, which is
%   trivially true.
% \end{proof}
