\chapter{Abstract}

The use of proof assistants as a tool for programming language theorists is
becoming ever more practical and widespread.
There is a range of satisfactory implementations of simply typed calculi in
proof assistants based on dependent type theory.

In this thesis, I extend an account of Simply Typed $\lambda$-calculus so as to
be able to represent and reason about calculi whose variables have restricted
usage patterns.
Examples of such calculi include a logic with an S4 $\Box$-modality, in which
certain variables cannot be used ``inside'' a box ($\Box$); and Linear Logic, in
which linear variables have to be used exactly once.
While there are existing implementations of some of these calculi in proof
assistants, many of these implementations share little with the best
presentations of simply typed calculi without variable usage restrictions, and
thus end up being poorly understood or suboptimal in facilitating mechanised
reasoning.

\begin{itemize}
  \item At least one satisfying account of simply typed calculi
    (via de Bruijn indices)
  \item Usage restrictions enrich the logic.
  \item I develop an account of usage-restricted calculi.
\end{itemize}
