\chapter{Introduction}

\chapter{Mathematical preliminaries}
  Categories, (co)products, monoidal categories, string diagrams (in Rel),
  monoid objects.
  Examples: Set, Rel, partial functions, commutative monoids.

\chapter{Linearity}
  \section{Intuitionistic linear logic}
  \input{ill.tex}
  \section{DILL}
  DILL provides a syntax in which $\oc$ is characterised by a universal
  property.
  There is no need for any rule to depend on the entire context and rebind
  variables (as done by BBdPH), so is more ND-like.
  DILL makes $\oc$ behave more like a positive type former (see the deep
  identity function $\oc A \vdash \oc A$).
  DILL has been extended to dependent types: Vakar15.

  The idea of split contexts can also be applied to left-/right-rule systems.
  (Define this DILL variant.)
