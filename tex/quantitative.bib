        abstract = {In programming, data is often considered to be infinitely copiable, arbitrarily discardable, and universally unconstrained. However this view is naive: some data encapsulates resources that are subject to protocols (e.g., file and device handles, channels); some data should not be arbitrarily copied or communicated (e.g., private data). Linear types provide a partial remedy by delineating data in two camps: "resources" to be used but never copied or discarded, and unconstrained values. However, this binary distinction is too coarse-grained. Instead, we propose the general notion of graded modal types, which in combination with linear and indexed types, provides an expressive type theory for enforcing fine-grained resource-like properties of data. We present a type system drawing together these aspects (linear, graded, and indexed) embodied in a fully-fledged functional language implementation, called Granule. We detail the type system, including its metatheoretic properties, and explore examples in the concrete language. This work advances the wider goal of expanding the reach of type systems to capture and verify a broader set of program properties.}

This calculus is derived from implicational Gentzen's sequent calculus LK, a key classical logical system in proof theory. Under the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we can see LK, or more precisely a formulation called LKμ , as a syntax-directed system of simple types for μ -calculus. For μ -calculus, choosing a call-by-name or call-by-value discipline for reduction amounts to choosing one of the two possible symmetric orientations of a critical pair. Our analysis leads us to revisit the question of what is a natural syntax for call-by-value functional computation. We define a translation of λμ-calculus into μ -calculus and two dual translations back to λ-calculus, and we recover known CPS translations by composing these translations.},

A line of work, including that of Filinski (1989), Griffin (1990), Parigot (1992), Danos, Joinet, and Schellinx (1995), Selinger (1998,2001), and Curien and Herbelin (2000), has led to the startling conclusion that call-by-value is the de Morgan dual of call-by-name.This paper presents a dual calculus that corresponds to the classical sequent calculus of Gentzen (1935) in the same way that the lambda calculus of Church (1932,1940) corresponds to the intuitionistic natural deduction of Gentzen (1935). The paper includes crisp formulations of call-by-value and call-by-name that are obviously dual; no similar formulations appear in the literature. The paper gives a CPS translation and its inverse, and shows that the translation is both sound and complete, strengthening a result in Curien and Herbelin (2000).},

Our system differs from previous calculi (e.g. that of Abramsky [1]) and has two important properties which they lack. These are the substitution property (the set of valid deductions is closed under substitution) and subject reduction (reduction on terms is well-typed). We also consider term reduction arising from cut-elimination in the sequent calculus and normalisation in natural deduction. We explore the relationship between these and consider their computational content.",

  abstract = {We show how to write generic programs and proofs in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. To this end we consider several extensions of Martin-L\"{o}f's logical framework for dependent types. Each extension has a universe of codes (signatures) for inductively defined sets with generic formation, introduction, elimination, and equality rules. These extensions are modeled on Dybjer and Setzer's finitely axiomatized theories of inductive-recursive definitions, which also have universes of codes for sets, and generic formation, introduction, elimination, and equality rules. Here we consider several smaller universes of interest for generic programming and universal algebra. We formalize one-sorted and many-sorted term algebras, as well as iterated, generalized, parameterized, and indexed inductive definitions. We also show how to extend the techniques of generic programming to these universes. Furthermore, we give generic proofs of reflexivity and substitutivity of a generic equality test: Most of the definitions in the paper have been implemented using the proof assistant Alfa for dependent type theory.},

  abstract = {Formalising metatheory in the Coq proof assistant is tedious as native support for reasoning about languages with binders is marginal at best. The Autosubst framework [9] automates working with de Brujin terms: for each annotated inductive type, it generates a corresponding substitution operation and a decision procedure for assumption-free substitution lemmas. A key part of the equational theory are parallel substitutions which combine multiple single-variable substitutions. However, due to its separate treatment of sorts Autosubst lacks support for mutual inductive types. This restriction is removed in our prototype implementation of Autosubst 2: second-order HOAS specifications are translated into potentially mutual inductive term sorts. Again, parallelising substitutions is the key: we introduce vector substitutions to combine the application of multiple parallel substitutions into exactly one instantiation operation for each sort. The resulting equational theory is both simpler and more expressive than that of the original Autosubst framework.},

  abstract = {The de Bruijn representation of syntax with binding is commonly used, but flawed when it comes to recursion. As the structural recursion principle associated to an inductive type of expressions is unaware of the binding discipline, each recursive definition requires a separate proof of compatibility with variable instantiation. We solve this problem by extending Allais' notion of syntax traversals to obtain a framework for instantiation-compatible recursion. The framework is general enough to handle multivariate, potentially mutually recursive syntactic systems. With our framework we define variable renaming and instantiation, syntax directed typing and certain unary logical relations for System F. These definitons lead to concise proofs of type preservation, as well as weak and strong normalisation. Our framework is designed to serve as the theoretical foundation of future versions of the Autosubst Coq library. All developments and case studies are formalised in the Coq proof assistant.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive research both on the theoretical and practical fronts, formalising, reasoning about, and implementing languages with variable binding is still a daunting endeavour – repetitive boilerplate and the overly complicated metatheory of capture-avoiding substitution often get in the way of progressing on to the actually interesting properties of a language. Existing developments offer some relief, however at the expense of inconvenient and error-prone term encodings and lack of formal foundations. We present a mathematically-inspired language-formalisation framework implemented in Agda. The system translates the description of a syntax signature with variable-binding operators into an intrinsically-encoded, inductive data type equipped with syntactic operations such as weakening and substitution, along with their correctness properties. The generated metatheory further incorporates metavariables and their associated operation of metasubstitution, which enables second-order equational/rewriting reasoning. The underlying mathematical foundation of the framework – initial algebra semantics – derives compositional interpretations of languages into their models satisfying the semantic substitution lemma by construction.},
