        abstract = {In programming, data is often considered to be infinitely copiable, arbitrarily discardable, and universally unconstrained. However this view is naive: some data encapsulates resources that are subject to protocols (e.g., file and device handles, channels); some data should not be arbitrarily copied or communicated (e.g., private data). Linear types provide a partial remedy by delineating data in two camps: "resources" to be used but never copied or discarded, and unconstrained values. However, this binary distinction is too coarse-grained. Instead, we propose the general notion of graded modal types, which in combination with linear and indexed types, provides an expressive type theory for enforcing fine-grained resource-like properties of data. We present a type system drawing together these aspects (linear, graded, and indexed) embodied in a fully-fledged functional language implementation, called Granule. We detail the type system, including its metatheoretic properties, and explore examples in the concrete language. This work advances the wider goal of expanding the reach of type systems to capture and verify a broader set of program properties.}

This calculus is derived from implicational Gentzen's sequent calculus LK, a key classical logical system in proof theory. Under the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we can see LK, or more precisely a formulation called LKμ , as a syntax-directed system of simple types for μ -calculus. For μ -calculus, choosing a call-by-name or call-by-value discipline for reduction amounts to choosing one of the two possible symmetric orientations of a critical pair. Our analysis leads us to revisit the question of what is a natural syntax for call-by-value functional computation. We define a translation of λμ-calculus into μ -calculus and two dual translations back to λ-calculus, and we recover known CPS translations by composing these translations.},

A line of work, including that of Filinski (1989), Griffin (1990), Parigot (1992), Danos, Joinet, and Schellinx (1995), Selinger (1998,2001), and Curien and Herbelin (2000), has led to the startling conclusion that call-by-value is the de Morgan dual of call-by-name.This paper presents a dual calculus that corresponds to the classical sequent calculus of Gentzen (1935) in the same way that the lambda calculus of Church (1932,1940) corresponds to the intuitionistic natural deduction of Gentzen (1935). The paper includes crisp formulations of call-by-value and call-by-name that are obviously dual; no similar formulations appear in the literature. The paper gives a CPS translation and its inverse, and shows that the translation is both sound and complete, strengthening a result in Curien and Herbelin (2000).},

  abstract = {We show how to write generic programs and proofs in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. To this end we consider several extensions of Martin-L\"{o}f's logical framework for dependent types. Each extension has a universe of codes (signatures) for inductively defined sets with generic formation, introduction, elimination, and equality rules. These extensions are modeled on Dybjer and Setzer's finitely axiomatized theories of inductive-recursive definitions, which also have universes of codes for sets, and generic formation, introduction, elimination, and equality rules. Here we consider several smaller universes of interest for generic programming and universal algebra. We formalize one-sorted and many-sorted term algebras, as well as iterated, generalized, parameterized, and indexed inductive definitions. We also show how to extend the techniques of generic programming to these universes. Furthermore, we give generic proofs of reflexivity and substitutivity of a generic equality test: Most of the definitions in the paper have been implemented using the proof assistant Alfa for dependent type theory.},

  abstract = {The de Bruijn representation of syntax with binding is commonly used, but flawed when it comes to recursion. As the structural recursion principle associated to an inductive type of expressions is unaware of the binding discipline, each recursive definition requires a separate proof of compatibility with variable instantiation. We solve this problem by extending Allais' notion of syntax traversals to obtain a framework for instantiation-compatible recursion. The framework is general enough to handle multivariate, potentially mutually recursive syntactic systems. With our framework we define variable renaming and instantiation, syntax directed typing and certain unary logical relations for System F. These definitons lead to concise proofs of type preservation, as well as weak and strong normalisation. Our framework is designed to serve as the theoretical foundation of future versions of the Autosubst Coq library. All developments and case studies are formalised in the Coq proof assistant.},

Existing developments offer some relief, however at the expense of inconvenient and error-prone term encodings and lack of formal foundations. We present a mathematically-inspired language-formalisation framework implemented in Agda. The system translates the description of a syntax signature with variable-binding operators into an intrinsically-encoded, inductive data type equipped with syntactic operations such as weakening and substitution, along with their correctness properties. The generated metatheory further incorporates metavariables and their associated operation of metasubstitution, which enables second-order equational/rewriting reasoning. The underlying mathematical foundation of the framework – initial algebra semantics – derives compositional interpretations of languages into their models satisfying the semantic substitution lemma by construction.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we take a pervasively effectful (in the style of ML) typed lambda calculus, and show how to extend it to permit capturing pure expressions with types. Our key observation is that, just as the pure simply-typed lambda calculus can be extended to support effects with a monadic type discipline, an impure typed lambda calculus can be extended to support purity with a comonadic type discipline. We establish the correctness of our type system via a simple denotational model, which we call the capability space model. Our model formalises the intuition common to systems programmers that the ability to perform effects should be controlled via access to a permission or capability, and that a program is capability-safe if it performs no effects that it does not have a runtime capability for. We then identify the axiomatic categorical structure that the capability space model validates, and use these axioms to give a categorical semantics for our comonadic type system. We then give an equational theory (substitution and the call-by-value β and η laws) for the imperative lambda calculus, and show its soundness relative to this semantics. Finally, we give a translation of the pure simply-typed lambda calculus into our comonadic imperative calculus, and show that any two terms which are βη-equal in the STLC are equal in the equational theory of the comonadic calculus, establishing that pure programs can be mapped in an equation-preserving way into our imperative calculus.},

Second-order universal algebra and second-order equational logic respectively provide a model theory and a formal deductive system for languages with variable binding and parameterised metavariables. This work completes the foundations of the subject from the viewpoint of categorical algebra. Specifically, the paper introduces the notion of second-order algebraic theory and develops its basic theory. Two categorical equivalences are established: at the syntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order algebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and second-order functorial models. Our development includes a mathematical definition of syntactic translation between second-order equational presentations. This gives the first formalisation of notions such as encodings and transforms in the context of languages with variable binding.",

  abstract = {The idea of a context lemma spans a range of programming-language models: from Milner’s original through the CIU theorem to ‘CIU-like’ results for multiple language features. Each shows that to prove observational equivalence between program terms it is enough to test only some restricted class of contexts: applicative, evaluation, reduction, etc. We formally reconstruct a distinctive proof method for context lemmas based on cyclic inclusion of three program approximations: by triangulating between ‘applicative’ and ‘logical’ relations we prove that both match the observational notion, while being simpler to compute. Moreover, the observational component of the triangle condenses a series of approximations covering variation in the literature around what variable-capturing structure qualifies as a ‘context’. Although entirely concrete, our approach involves no term dissection or inspection of reduction sequences; instead we draw on previous context lemmas using operational logical relations and biorthogonality. We demonstrate the method for a fine-grained call-by-value presentation of the simply-typed lambda-calculus, and extend to a CIU result formulated with frame stacks. All this is formalised and proved in Agda: building on work of Allais et al., we exploit dependent types to specify lambda-calculus terms as well-typed and well-scoped by construction. By doing so, we seek to dispel any lingering anxieties about the manipulation of concrete contexts when reasoning about bound variables, capturing substitution, and observational equivalences.},

It is designed to support concurrency and parallelism in building applications and libraries that take full advantage of modern hardware. Rust's static type system is safe1 and expressive and provides strong guarantees about isolation, concurrency, and memory safety.Rust also offers a clear performance model, making it easier to predict and reason about program efficiency. One important way it accomplishes this is by allowing fine-grained control over memory representations, with direct support for stack allocation and contiguous record storage. The language balances such controls with the absolute requirement for safety: Rust's type system and runtime guarantee the absence of data races, buffer overflows, stack overflows, and accesses to uninitialized or deallocated memory.},

However, in the presence of dependent types, there often exist some acute problems that make it difficult for {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}PTS{\}}{\$}to accommodate many common realistic programming features such as general recursion, recursive types, effects (e.g., exceptions, references, input/output), etc. In this paper, we propose a new framework Applied Type System ({\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}ATS{\}}{\$}) to allow for designing and formalizing type systems that can readily support common realistic programming features. The key salient feature of {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}ATS{\}}{\$}lies in a complete separation between statics, in which types are formed and reasoned about, and dynamics, in which programs are constructed and evaluated. With this separation, it is no longer possible for a program to occur in a type as is otherwise allowed in {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}PTS{\}}{\$}. We present not only a formal development of {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}ATS{\}}{\$}but also mention some examples in support of using {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}ATS{\}}{\$}as a framework to form type systems for practical programming.",

  abstract = {Behavioural type systems, usually associated to concurrent or distributed computations, encompass concepts such as interfaces, communication protocols, and contracts, in addition to the traditional input/output operations. The behavioural type of a software component specifies its expected patterns of interaction using expressive type languages, so types can be used to determine automatically whether the component interacts correctly with other components. Two related important notions of behavioural types are those of session types and behavioural contracts. This article surveys the main accomplishments of the last 20 years within these two approaches.},
