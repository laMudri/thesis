\subsection{Renaming and substitution}

In an unpublished note, \citet{McBride05} gives a parametrised traversal
yielding homomorphisms of syntax.
The parameters are collected in the record \AgdaRecord{Kit}.
We make a minor change to the original presentation, where instead of our
\AgdaField{ren\textasciicircum{}$\V$} field, \citeauthor{McBride05} has the
field \AgdaField{wk} allowing only context extensions.
As for the other two fields, \AgdaField{vr} allows us to map variables to
$\V$-values, so as to put newly bound variables in environments; and
\AgdaField{tm} allows us to extract terms from $\V$-values, as required when
we use the environment to evaluate a free variable.

Where \citeauthor{McBride05} gave the traversal explicitly, we go via our
generic semantic traversal.
The first two fields of \AgdaRecord{Semantics} derive directly from fields of
\AgdaRecord{Kit}.
Meanwhile, to handle term constructors, we first \AgdaFunction{reify} to get a
collection of traversed subterms, and then use \AgdaInductiveConstructor{`con}
to assemble these subterms into a similarly shaped syntactic form as we started
with.
The \AgdaField{vr} field is used implicitly in \AgdaFunction{reify}, as it is
used to show that $\V$-identity environments exist.
