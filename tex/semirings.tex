\chapter{Usage restriction via semirings}\label{sec:semirings}

The methods described in \cref{sec:simple} for the simply typed
$\lambda$-calculus
make crucial use of \emph{weakening} --- the fact that if we have
$\Gamma \vdash A$, then we also have $\Gamma, \Delta \vdash A$.
We use this property to update environments as we take them under binders.
However, as we saw in \cref{sec:linearity}, there are interesting calculi in
which general weakening does not hold.
As such, one of the aims of this chapter will be to find a form of weakening
applicable to variables of any type, while essentially retaining linearity
(as opposed to affineness).

This chapter proceeds as follows.
In \cref{sec:semiring-motivation}, I give an intuitive introduction to semiring
annotations on variables, based on replicating features of DILL (introduced in
\cref{sec:dill}).
Then, \cref{sec:lr} formalises the ideas of \cref{sec:semiring-motivation} into
a calculus $\name$.
This calculus has
appeared in my previous work~\citep{WA21}, and can be seen as a
simply typed version of Atkey's dependently typed calculus QTT~\citep{Atkey18}.
%The idea of \name{} is to augment the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus with
%annotations on free variables, and give enough types to manipulate these
%annotations.
Given this new calculus $\name$, the first goal is to apply the techniques of
\cref{sec:simple} to it, yielding a simultaneous substitution operation.
To do this, I use \cref{sec:lnd} to introduce notation that allows us to restate
the typing rules of \name{} to not mention contexts explicitly, as was the style
in \cref{sec:simple}.
This new notation --- the \emph{bunched connectives} --- is versatile at
defining simply typed usage-aware syntaxes, and I give further non-$\name$
examples in \cref{sec:variant}.
Finally, I justify connections to linear logic and modal logic in
\cref{sec:translation}, where I translate $\name$ terms to and from
DILL~\citep{Barber1996} and the modal calculus of \citet{judgmental}.

\section{Motivation for semiring annotations}\label{sec:semiring-motivation}

The question of defining calculi which do not semantically admit weakening and
contraction but also do not rely on variables going out of scope is directly
addressed by \citet{McBride16}.
The first technique suggested is to, instead of
removing variables from the context of certain subterms, add an annotation to
free variables saying whether or not they are to be used.
I use an annotation $\gr0$ on variables that are not to be used, and an
annotation $\gr1$ on variables that are to be used.
This convention lets us transcribe the usual $\otimes$-introduction rule
(below left) as a rule with usage annotations (below right).
In the notation on the right, I let $\Gamma = \grP\gamma$ and
$\Delta = \grQ\delta$, where $\Gamma$ is a whole context comprising a
\emph{usage context} $\grP$ and a \emph{typing context} $\gamma$.
A usage context is a list of usage annotations, so
$\grP = \gr{r_1}, \ldots, \gr{r_m}$ and a typing context is a list of types, so
$\gamma = A_1, \ldots, A_m$.
When combined, the usage context and the typing context will be of the same
length.
Explicit contexts will usually be written with usage annotations and types
interspersed, as $\gr{r_1}A_1, \ldots, \gr{r_m}A_m$.
I use $\gr r\gamma$ to abbreviate $\gr rx_1, \ldots, \gr rx_m$.

\[
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\Gamma \vdash A}
    \hypo{\Delta \vdash B}
    \infer2{\Gamma, \Delta \vdash A \otimes B}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\gr1\gamma, \gr0\delta \vdash A}
    \hypo{\gr0\gamma, \gr1\delta \vdash B}
    \infer2{\gr1\gamma, \gr1\delta \vdash A \otimes B}
  }
\]

The eventual target of all these $\gr0$-annotated variables is the variable
rule, which I transcribe as follows.
The $\gr1$ shows us that we can use the variable thus annotated, while the
$\gr0$s let us discard all of the other variables in $\gamma$.

\[
  \ebrule{%
    \infer0{A \vdash A}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \infer0{\gr0\gamma, \gr1A \vdash A}
  }
\]

The use of $\gr0$ gives us the property that variables never go out of
scope in subterms; rather, we lose the ability to use certain variables, but
retain the ability to refer to them metatheoretically.
Additionally, we recover a form of weakening: if $\Gamma \vdash A$, then also
$\Gamma, \gr0\delta \vdash A$, because the resulting term indeed uses no
variables from $\delta$.
I prove the admissibility of weakening for terms will come in \cref{sec:lrsub}.

If we follow the DILL style of variable management explained in \cref{sec:dill},
there are not just the two
states \emph{to be used} ($\gr1$) and \emph{not to be used} ($\gr0$), but also
\emph{usable unrestrictedly}.
If we assign unrestricted (or \emph{intuitionistic}) variables an annotation
$\gr\omega$, we can make the following transcription of the DILL
$\otimes$-introduction rule.

\[
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\Theta; \Gamma \vdash A}
    \hypo{\Theta; \Delta \vdash B}
    \infer2{\Theta; \Gamma, \Delta \vdash A \otimes B}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\gr\omega\theta, \gr1\gamma, \gr0\delta \vdash A}
    \hypo{\gr\omega\theta, \gr0\gamma, \gr1\delta \vdash B}
    \infer2{\gr\omega\theta, \gr1\gamma, \gr1\delta \vdash A \otimes B}
  }
\]

To conceptualise the criteria on the usage annotations involved in this rule,
I introduce an additive structure over usage annotations.
The rule stated above relies on the facts that $\gr1 + \gr0 = \gr1$,
$\gr0 + \gr1 = \gr1$, and $\gr\omega + \gr\omega = \gr\omega$.
Addition lifts pointwise to vectors of usage annotations (the green capital
calligraphic $\grP$, $\grQ$, and $\grR$).
A beneficial side-effect of the fact that $\gr0 + \gr0 = \gr0$ is that the
rule on the right below is actually more general, and accepts $\gr0$-annotated
variables in its
conclusion, which is essential for weakening to be admissible.

\[
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\gr\omega\theta, \gr1\gamma, \gr0\delta \vdash A}
    \hypo{\gr\omega\theta, \gr0\gamma, \gr1\delta \vdash B}
    \infer2{\gr\omega\theta, \gr1\gamma, \gr1\delta \vdash A \otimes B}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\grR = \grP + \grQ}
    \hypo{\grP\gamma \vdash A}
    \hypo{\grQ\gamma \vdash B}
    \infer3{\grR\gamma \vdash A \otimes B}
  }
\]

Some other transcriptions from DILL to the usage annotation style are as
follows.
I unify the variable rules (the one for linear variables and the one for
intuitionistic variables) by introducing a coercibility ordering $\leq$ on usage
annotations.
We have $\gr\omega \leq \gr1$ because an intuitionistic variable can fill the
demand of a linear variable by dereliction.
We also have $\gr\omega \leq \gr0$, because intuitionistic variables can be
weakened away like $\gr0$-annotated variables.
This ordering information is shown in the diagram
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
  \node(omega) at (0,0) {$\gr\omega$};
  \node(0) [above left of=omega] {$\gr0$};
  \node(1) [above right of=omega] {$\gr1$};

  \draw (omega) -- (0);
  \draw (omega) -- (1);
\end{tikzpicture}.
All together, this means that at the (only) variable rule, the variable being
used must have annotation less than or equal to $\gr1$, and every other variable
must have annotation less than or equal to $\gr0$.
I write this requirement as $\grR \leq \langle x \rvert$, where
$\langle x \rvert$ is the \emph{basis vector} at position $x$.

\[
  \ebrule{%
    \infer0{\Theta; A \vdash A}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \infer0{\gr\omega\theta, \gr1A, \gr0\delta \vdash A}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\grR \leq \bra x}
    \hypo{\gamma_x = A}
    \infer2{\grR\gamma \vdash A}
  }
\]

\[
  \ebrule{%
    \infer0{\Theta, A; {\cdot} \vdash A}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \infer0{\gr\omega\theta, \gr\omega A, \gr0\delta \vdash A}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\grR \leq \bra x}
    \hypo{\gamma_x = A}
    \infer2{\grR\gamma \vdash A}
  }
\]

The final interesting rule form to cover is found in DILL's
$\oc$-introduction rule.
DILL's $\oc$-introduction can be though of as an $\gr\omega$-ary counterpart to
$\otimes$-introduction, though with the same premise each time rather than
$\gr\omega$-many premises.
This explains why only $\gr\omega$- and
$\gr0$-annotated variables can appear in the conclusion of $\oc$-introduction,
and also justifies the choice below of multiplication (vector scaling) as the
algebraic operation controlling the $\oc$-modality.

\[
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\Theta; {\cdot} \vdash A}
    \infer1{\Theta; {\cdot} \vdash \oc A}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\gr\omega\theta, \gr0\delta \vdash A}
    \infer1{\gr\omega\theta, \gr0\delta \vdash \oc A}
  }
  \quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
  \ebrule{%
    \hypo{\grR \leq \gr\omega\grP}
    \hypo{\grP\gamma \vdash A}
    \infer2{\grR\gamma \vdash \oc_{\gr\omega} A}
  }
\]

In summary, the structure we have required of the set of usage annotations is
that they have addition (for $\otimes$-introduction and similar rules),
multiplication (for $\oc$-introduction), a $1$ (for a variable being used), a
$0$ (for a variable not being used), and an ordering (allowing for subsumption
of usage restrictions).
Together, these form a \emph{partially ordered semiring} (posemiring), the laws
of which are both supported by examples and necessary for the syntax to be well
behaved.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{semiring} is a monoid in the multicategory of commutative monoids and
  multilinear maps.
  Unpacked, this means that we have a set $\mathscr R$ together with elements
  $0$ and $1$ and binary operators $+$ and $\cdot$ (with $\cdot$ usually written
  as juxtaposition) such that the following hold for all
  $x, y, z \in \mathscr R$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $0 + x = x$; $x + 0 = x$; $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$; $x + y = y + x$
    \item $1x = x$; $x1 = x$; $(xy)z = x(yz)$
    \item $0x = 0$; $x0 = 0$; $(x + y)z = xz + yz$; $x(y + z) = xy + xz$
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{posemiring} is a semiring in the category of partially ordered sets
  (posets).
  Unpacked, this means that we have a semiring (in the category of sets)
  $(\mathscr R, 0, +, 1, \cdot)$ such that $\mathscr R$ has a partial order
  (written $\leq$) and addition and multiplication are monotonic with respect
  to $\leq$ in both arguments.
\end{definition}

For concreteness, I collect together the definition of the
$\{\gr0, \gr1, \gr\omega\}$ posemiring I have been using so far.

\begin{example}\label{def:lin-semiring}
  The \emph{$\{\gr0, \gr1, \gr\omega\}$ posemiring}, also known as the
  \emph{linearity posemiring}, has the operations given as follows, with
  $0 \coloneqq \gr0$ and $1 \coloneqq \gr1$:

  \makebox[\textwidth][s]{
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
      $+$ & $\gr0$ & $\gr1$ & $\gr\omega$ \\ \hline
      $\gr0$ & $\gr0$ & $\gr1$ & $\gr\omega$ \\
      $\gr1$ & $\gr1$ & $\gr\omega$ & $\gr\omega$ \\
      $\gr\omega$ & $\gr\omega$ & $\gr\omega$ & $\gr\omega$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
      $*$ & $\gr0$ & $\gr1$ & $\gr\omega$ \\ \hline
      $\gr0$ & $\gr0$ & $\gr0$ & $\gr0$ \\
      $\gr1$ & $\gr0$ & $\gr1$ & $\gr\omega$ \\
      $\gr\omega$ & $\gr0$ & $\gr\omega$ & $\gr\omega$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline]
      \node(omega) at (0,0) {$\gr\omega$};
      \node(0) [above left of=omega] {$\gr0$};
      \node(1) [above right of=omega] {$\gr1$};

      \draw (omega) -- (0);
      \draw (omega) -- (1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  }
\end{example}

%In \cref{sec:simple}, we saw that the logical rules of simply typed
%$\lambda$-calculus can be described in terms of three basic premise combinators:
%$\dot1$, standing for no premises; $\dottimes$, allowing for multiple premises
%in the same context; and $\Theta \vdash A$, requiring a subterm of type $A$
%having bound the extra variables from context $\Theta$.
%However, we remember from \cref{sec:linearity} that in a substructural setting,
%we do not always want to copy assumptions for use in all subterms.
%This motivates me to introduce the additional premise combinators $I^*$, $\sep$,
%and $\cdot$ in \cref{sec:lnd}, allowing for the modes of usage exhibited in
%the introduction rules for $I$, $\otimes$, and $\oc$, respectively.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:semirings-conc}

In this chapter, I have presented the calculus $\name$, with particular focus on
the posemiring usage annotations.
Posemirings are sufficient for many use cases, as shown by the examples in this
chapter.
However, there are many more substructural disciplines in the literature which
cannot be expressed using posemirings.

An important point to note is that $\name$ cannot be instantiated to become a
bunched logic, in the sense of \citet{oHP99}.
This is despite the use of the bunched connectives in the \emph{definition} of
$\name$, and despite the formally tree-shaped contexts.
However, the variable rule of $\name$ essentially treats the variables in the
context independently, except for the individual checking of usage annotations
on each variable.
Therefore, we cannot talk about more interesting spatial relationships between
variables, as required by bunched logic.
This property also precludes us from capturing calculi without exchange
(non-commutative logics), such as Lambek calculus~\citep{Lambek58}.
Fitch-style systems~\citep{Borghuis-thesis} probably also are precluded
similarly.

The work I present here has some methodological similarities with the earlier
work of \citet{LicataSR17}.
In that framework, one can provide a very precise \emph{mode theory}, expressing
which structural rules are available, and from it get a sequent calculus with
cut-elimination.
They encode many systems, including a non-associative logic (where context are
trees obeying no structural rules) and a bunched logic, and the framework is
probably expressive enough to encode all posemiring-based usage disciplines.
However, aside from the structural rules, the sequent calculus is fixed ---
there are two connectives: $\mathsf F$ (internalising the left of the sequent,
comparable to my
$\oc_{\gr{r_1}}\plr{-} \otimes \cdots \otimes \oc_{\gr{r_n}}\plr{-}$) and
$\mathsf U$ (internalising the whole sequent, comparable to my
$\oc_{\gr{r_1}}\plr{-} \multimap \cdots \multimap \oc_{\gr{r_n}}\plr{-}
\multimap \plr{-}$), which have left and right rules, and then the only other
rule is the variable rule.
This restriction is what allows the cut elimination theorem to be even
plausible, but means that other connectives, like additives and inductive types,
and more exotic syntaxes, like those I will present in
\cref{sec:other-syntaxes}, would have to be developed from scratch.

The distinction between sharing and separating conjunction of premises naturally
falls out of the posemiring approach to usage restrictions.
However, a similar distinction also appears in other approaches to linearity,
and perhaps in other substructural systems.
Indeed, in the paper that inspired the bunched connectives~\citep{RPKV20},
linearity is enforced in a similar style as in Yalla~\citep{laurent18}, using
lists which can be split.
It would be interesting to see future work on substructural systems work out the
appropriate premise connectives and define their systems from there, rather than
directly manipulating contexts.
It may also be possible to see future work profitably abstracting over the
posemiring annotations, requiring only that contexts form something like a
commutative $\mathrm{Rel}$-monoid supporting variable-binding and
variable access.
